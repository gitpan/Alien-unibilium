NAME
    `Alien::unibilium' - Alien wrapping for unibilium

DESCRIPTION
    This CPAN distribution wraps the C library unibilium in a wrapper
    suitable to drive CPAN and other Perl-related build infrastructure.

    If the C library is already installed and known by pkg-config, this
    module provides a simple access to its configuration. If not, the
    process of installing it will install a locally-bundled copy of the
    library into perl's arch-specific library directory.

    This module bundles unibilium version v1.1.0.

METHODS
    This module behaves like ExtUtils::PkgConfig, responding to the same
    methods, except that the module name is implied. Thus, the configuration
    can be obtained by calling

     $cflags = Alien::unibilium->cflags
     $libs = Alien::unibilium->libs

     $ok = Alien::unibilium->atleast_version( $version )

     etc...
